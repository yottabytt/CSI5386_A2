A dog is near the red ball in the air
A boy in blue are sliding down a green slide
A man is strolling in the rain
There is no brown dog and black dog playing in the sand
A white and brown dog is walking through the water with difficulty
There is no girl in pink twirling a ribbon
The flute is being played by one man
A white bird is landing swiftly in the water
Two people wearing helmets are driving over the yellow and white flowers
The snowboarder is leaping fearlessly over white snow
